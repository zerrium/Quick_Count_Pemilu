# Quick Count Pemilu
Developed with Netbeans 11 using JDK 8, jdbc 8.0.15 driver, and Java swing for the GUI<br>
This application is a quick count for Indonesian election back in 2019<br>
This application is only the replication of [this website](https://pemilu2019.kpu.go.id/#/ppwp/hitung-suara/). Therefore, it is not connected nor related to the real KPU data at all and this application is only for educational purpose

## Compatibility
Any system with JDK 8 or later installed and MySQL 8.0 server installed
